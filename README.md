# R-and-the-RStudio
# Shuffle_the_deck :
#Create two functions with the following capabilities:
  
#Shuffle the deck (Function 1).

#Deal 5 cards to the players depending on how many players are in the game.

#Depending on the number of players if the number of cards needed is more than 52 cards, then your function should output that there are not enough cards for everyone before dealing. (Function 2).

#Save the cards each player gets to a variable designated for that player.

#Repeat tasks the 1st task but this time create a function that can deal 5, 7, or 10 cards for each player. 

#Note: The number of cards dealt could be an input for your function.

#Using your shuffle and deal function, create the following if-else statements (You may also need a for-loop to accomplish this task):

#Create a 2-player game that calculates the value of each hand using the "Value" column and create an if-else statement that says if player 1 or player 2 has more points.

#Note: The number of players is always 2 but the number of cards they receive depends on the user input.

#Your output should show if Player 1 or Player 2 has more points by saying, "Player 1 has more points than Player 2. Player 1: <point value here>, Player 2: <point value here>"

# Thearter-Rstudio:

#Make sure you do not have more people attending your movie than you have seats.

#The number of adults and children in the theater should be randomized.

#Make sure to answer the 3 questions at the bottom of the starter code.

#1. Create snacks that the customers can buy and randomize who buys which snack

#2. Pretend you own multiple theaters and run two simulations to represent each theater and plot the results

#3. Create conditional statements for movies that may be PG-13 and children are not allowed to watch

# 10-sided dice:

#Create a 10-sided dice.

#Create a function to roll the dice 6 times and calculate the sum of those 6 rolls.

#create 20-sided dice.

#Create another function to calculate how many dice rolled more than 6 (for the 10-sided) or 16 (for the 20-sided).
